### Spending Tracker v1.0

## Basic Features

1. Record spending in MYR and GBP (Using python sqlite3 database)
2. View spending records in MYR, GBP, or both
3. Different frequency for viewing records: weekly, monthly, all time

## Drawbacks

1. No manual entry for spending date
2. Lacking a more versatile and robust viewing system

## Future Ideas

1. Package the app into mobile environment
2. Speech to text smart recognition to remove friction of entering records
